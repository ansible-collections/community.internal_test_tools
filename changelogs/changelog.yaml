      - Ansible markup will show up in raw form on ansible-doc text output for ansible-core
        before 2.15. If you have trouble deciphering the documentation markup, please
        upgrade to ansible-core 2.15 (or newer), or read the HTML documentation on
        https://ansible-collections.github.io/community.internal_test_tools/branch/main/.
      release_summary: 'Maintenance release with updated documentation and removal
        of a deprecated tool.


        From this version on, community.internal_test_tools is using the new `Ansible
        semantic markup

        <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#semantic-markup-within-module-documentation>`__

        in its documentation. If you look at documentation with the ansible-doc CLI
        tool

        from ansible-core before 2.15, please note that it does not render the markup

        correctly. You should be still able to read it in most cases, but you need

        ansible-core 2.15 or later to see it as it is intended. Alternatively you
        can

        look at `the docsite <https://ansible-collections.github.io/community.internal_test_tools/branch/main/>`__

        for the rendered HTML version of the documentation of the latest release.

      removed_features:
      - Removed the deprecated ``meta/runtime.yml`` tool (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/issues/79,

      release_summary: Maintenance release to test whether publishing community collections
        works.

    release_date: '2023-10-04'
  0.11.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - The internal test module ``fetch_url_test_module`` has been renamed to ``_fetch_url_test_module``,
        and the internal test lookup plugin ``open_url_test_lookup`` has been renamed
        to ``_open_url_test_lookup``. This emphasizes that these plugins are private
        and not supposed to be used by end-users  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/112).
      bugfixes:
      - extra sanity test runner - run pip via Python instead of running it directly;
        also set ``PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1`` in the environment (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/104).
      deprecated_features:
      - The ``tools/ansible_builtin_runtime.py`` tool is deprecated and will be removed
        in a future version. If anyone is interested in keeping this tool, please
        comment on the `tool removal issue <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/issues/111>`__
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/issues/111).
      minor_changes:
      - extra sanity test runner - make sure that a ``ansible_collections`` ancestor
        directory is also copied into the Docker container (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/103).

      major_changes:
      - There is now a `extra sanity test runner <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/tree/main/tools/README.md>`_
        which allows to easily run extra sanity tests. This is a stop-gap solution
        until ansible-test supports sanity test plugins.

      - Fix header test for ``fetch_url`` testing framework (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/24).
      minor_changes:
      - Added a framework for testing plugins using ``open_url`` from ``ansible.module_utils.urls``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/24).
      - The ``fetch_url`` testing framework now allows to match the provided content
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/31).
      - There are now a `meta/runtime.yml and ansible_builtin_runtime.yml helper tools
        <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/tree/main/tools/README.md>`_
        which allows to convert between symlinks and redirects in ``meta/runtime.yml``,
        allows to compare ansible-base's ``lib/ansible/config/ansible_builtin_runtime.yml``
        with this collection, and verify that plugins mentioned actually exist.

        ansible-test from ansible-core 2.12 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/47).
      minor_changes:
      - '``fetch_url`` and ``open_url`` test frameworks - output number of expected
        and actual calls when number of actual calls is too low.'
      - ansible_builtin_runtime tool - allow to specify collection root directory

        ansible-core ``devel`` branch (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/52).
