      major_changes:
      - There is now a `extra sanity test runner <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/tree/main/tools/README.md>`_
        which allows to easily run extra sanity tests. This is a stop-gap solution
        until ansible-test supports sanity test plugins.
