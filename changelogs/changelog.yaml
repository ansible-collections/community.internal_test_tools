      major_changes:
      - There is now a `extra sanity test runner <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/tree/main/tools/README.md>`_
        which allows to easily run extra sanity tests. This is a stop-gap solution
        until ansible-test supports sanity test plugins.

  0.2.1:
    changes:
      release_summary: Re-release because Galaxy did not accept a tag with spaces
        in ``galaxy.yml``. No other changes besides that the changelog moved to the
        root directory.

  0.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix form value present test for ``fetch_url`` testing framework (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/24).
      - Fix header test for ``fetch_url`` testing framework (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/24).
      minor_changes:
      - Added a framework for testing plugins using ``open_url`` from ``ansible.module_utils.urls``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/24).
      - The ``fetch_url`` testing framework now allows to match the provided content
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/pull/31).
      - There are now a `meta/runtime.yml and ansible_builtin_runtime.yml helper tools
        <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/tree/main/tools/README.md>`_
        which allows to convert between symlinks and redirects in ``meta/runtime.yml``,
        allows to compare ansible-base's ``lib/ansible/config/ansible_builtin_runtime.yml``
        with this collection, and verify that plugins mentioned actually exist.
