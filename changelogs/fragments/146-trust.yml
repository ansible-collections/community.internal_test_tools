    Provide helper utility ``ansible_collections.community.internal_test_tools.tests.unit.utils.trust`` for tests that
    need to handle both ansible-core versions with and without Data Tagging:


    * The helper functions ``make_trusted()`` and ``make_untrusted()`` mark a value as trusted respectively untrusted (with Data Tagging), or as safe or unsafe (before Data Tagging).

    * The function ``is_trusted()`` allows to check with all versions of ansible-core whether a value is trusted (not unsafe) or not trusted (unsafe).

    * The constant ``SUPPORTS_DATA_TAGGING`` allows to decide whether ansible-core supports Data Tagging or not.


    Note that Data Tagging support right now is not implemented and will be added later
