minor_changes:
- There is now a `meta/runtime.yml helper tool <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.internal_test_tools/tree/main/tools/README.md>`_ which allows to convert between symlinks and redirects in ``meta/runtime.yml``, and allows to compare ansible-base's ``lib/ansible/config/ansible_builtin_runtime.yml`` with this collection.
