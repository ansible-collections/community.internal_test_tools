release_summary: |
  Maintenance release with updated documentation and removal of a deprecated tool.

  From this version on, community.internal_test_tools is using the new `Ansible semantic markup
  <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#semantic-markup-within-module-documentation>`__
  in its documentation. If you look at documentation with the ansible-doc CLI tool
  from ansible-core before 2.15, please note that it does not render the markup
  correctly. You should be still able to read it in most cases, but you need
  ansible-core 2.15 or later to see it as it is intended. Alternatively you can
  look at `the docsite <https://ansible-collections.github.io/community.internal_test_tools/branch/main/>`__
  for the rendered HTML version of the documentation of the latest release.
